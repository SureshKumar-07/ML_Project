# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a machine learning model. The dataset used for this project contains various medical features related to diabetes and is employed to train a classification model. The model predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on their health metrics.

## Features
- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using a machine learning model.
- Utilizes various health metrics including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle. It includes the following columns:
- `Pregnancies`
- `Glucose`
- `BloodPressure`
- `SkinThickness`
- `Insulin`
- `BMI`
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
- `Age`
- `Outcome` (Target variable indicating whether diabetes is present or not)
