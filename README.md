# Diabetic Prediction

## Overview

This Kaggle notebook explores the prediction of diabetes using various machine learning models. The goal is to build a reliable model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on their medical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from the Kaggle dataset repository. It includes various features related to patient health and is used to train and evaluate different machine learning models.

### Features

- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: Insulin level (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `Outcome`: Target variable (1 if diabetes is present, 0 otherwise)

## Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data distribution and relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models to predict diabetes, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the results and discuss the best-performing model.
